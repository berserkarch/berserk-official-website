# ⚔️ Berserk Arch Linux — The Beginning of Madness and Mastery

Welcome to the **first ever blog post** on the **Berserk Arch Linux** project.  
This marks the official start of documenting not just a distro — but an **idea**.  
An idea born out of obsession, precision, and a bit of chaos.

Let’s call this the **Markdown Style Guide**, sure.  
But let’s also call it the **Origin Story of Berserk Arch**.

---

## 🩸 What is Berserk Arch Linux?

**Berserk Arch Linux** isn’t your typical Arch spin.  
It’s a **handcrafted system** built by a **Red Team Operator** and **Software Engineer** who believes that control, customization, and chaos can coexist beautifully.

> “Organized screams steadiness. Messy screams living.”  
> — The spirit behind Berserk Arch

Berserk Arch is designed primarily for **virtualized environments** — QEMU/KVM, VMware, VirtualBox — but it runs just as beautifully on bare metal if you dare.  
It’s **lean**, **clean**, and **deadly efficient** — like a blade sharpened for precision work.

---

## 🧠 The Philosophy

At its heart, Berserk Arch is driven by three principles:

1. **Performance** — Every process should justify its existence.
2. **Security** — Encryption, hardening, and minimalism are built-in, not optional.
3. **Control** — Every package, script, and configuration is _yours_ to shape.

This distro isn’t about making Linux “easy.”  
It’s about making Linux **yours** — and making it **respect you back**.

---

## ⚙️ Core Components

Berserk Arch is structured around modular packages and clear separation of layers:

| Component           | Description                                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **berserk-core**    | The soul of the system: base configs, themes, and scripts. |
| **berserk-aur**     | Precompiled AUR helpers and curated community tools.       |
| **berserk-extra**   | Optional software, extensions, and workstation utilities.  |
| **berserk-testing** | The experimental ground — bleeding edge and unstable.      |

The system is managed through a **Calamares-based installer** with deep customization support.

- Full Disk Encryption (with keyfile & Plymouth unlock support)
- Swap encryption
- Optional `packagechooser` feature for selective installs
- Post-install cleanup script for removing unselected packages

No bloat. No gimmicks. Just **you and the machine**.

## 🎨 The Visual Touch

Berserk Arch isn’t just powerful — it’s **aesthetic**.

- Display Manager: **SDDM**
- Window Manager: **Openbox** (lightweight, minimal, brutalist)
- GTK + Qt theming support
- Custom **Plymouth animations**
- Personalized **GRUB themes**

If you’ve ever wanted your boot process to look like the opening of a dark anime — you’re going to love this.

---

## 🧩 Developer’s Choice

The distro is meant to be **developer-friendly** out of the box — not beginner-friendly.  
It’s made for people who know what they’re doing (or want to learn the hard way).

### Preinstalled Toolsets

- **Coding**: Vim + Neovim, GCC, Rust, Python, Go
- **Security/Red Teaming**: Chisel, Ligolo, Sliver, Villain, Netcat, Metasploit
- **System Tools**: Tmux, Htop, Curl, Git, Nmap, and more
- **Networking**: SSH, socat, WireGuard

Every tool is **preconfigured for efficiency** and **minimal interference**.

---

## 🧱 Built for Red Teams and Hackers

Let’s be honest — Berserk Arch isn’t meant for casual users.  
It’s for people who _enjoy breaking things_ to understand how they work.

It’s perfect for:

- Offensive Security professionals
- Penetration testers
- Red Team operators
- Developers who want full control of their workflow
- Tinkerers who like living dangerously

The distro is tuned for **virtual lab setups**, **C2 frameworks**, **reverse shells**, and **post-exploitation research**.

You can spin up environments, test payloads, manage pivots, and automate deployment — all without fighting your own system.

---

## 🛠️ Future Roadmap

The project is just getting started, but here’s what’s coming next:

- **Netinstall Mode:**  
  Dynamic package installation via `packagechooser` + Python cleanup system.

- **Cloudflare R2 Integration:**  
  Hosting ISOs and package repositories under a custom domain — `iso.berserkarch.xyz`.

- **Public Wiki:**  
  Detailed changelogs for every release — `wiki.berserkarch.xyz/changelogs`.

- **Profiles:**  
  Choose between _Dev_, _Red Team_, _Minimal_, and _Desktop_ setups.

## 🐉 Why the Name “Berserk”?

Because it fits.

Like the manga _Berserk_, this distro represents **pain, growth, and mastery through struggle**.  
Every Arch user knows — the system rewards those who **suffer through the setup** and **learn to tame the chaos**.

Berserk Arch is that spirit in operating system form.  
It’s not meant to be _easy_.  
It’s meant to be _yours_.

## 🧾 Final Words

This blog — and this Markdown post — is just the beginning.

From here on out, expect:

- Developer notes
- Security deep dives
- Theming and design breakdowns
- Architecture philosophy essays
- Maybe even a few personal war stories
